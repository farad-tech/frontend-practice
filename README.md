# Frontend practice
I developed this frontend as practice.

You can see UI desgin of this code at [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/gG1V28DT367UybFuXBcD9Q/FrontEnd-Practice-(Community)?type=design&node-id=1%3A33&mode=dev).

I`m not using any framework or library so It should be very fast on loading in internet page. just using pure CSS and Javascript and ofcourse HTML.

It took 15 hours to develop this page.

**Coding this page is not completed yet!** It will soon.

Thankyou.
